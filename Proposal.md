## Proposal

### Domain Background
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a technique that analyses visual imagery with the help of multiple (deep) neural layers. It can be used to classify images, recognize objects, or detect anomalies in speech waveforms. In any case, the input should be an image in some way. The different between image classification and object recognition is that in the former you are trying to return 1 match and in the latter you are returning a list of objects found in the image. In this project, we will be looking at image classification, in particular, classification of dog breeds. On one hand, this classification sounds simple (especially to a dog lover), however, there are several breeds that are closely related and the differences are subtle, difficult even for the human eye.
