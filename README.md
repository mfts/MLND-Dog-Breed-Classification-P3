# Classifying Dog Breeds

## Introduction

The challenge is to build a classifier than can differentiate between dogs and humans in an image and then correctly classify the dog's breed. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Furthermore, the notebook will explore state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization.
